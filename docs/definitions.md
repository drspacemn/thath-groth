# Definition of terms

### `pairing-friendly`

Elliptic curves with a large prime-order subgroup `r` and a small embedding degree `k`.
A family of pairing-friendly elliptic curves (PF-EC) must satisfy the following conditions:

1) `r` is large enough so that it is hard to solve DLP by Pollardâ€™s rho method
2) `k` is big enough so that subexponential methods for computing DLP in Fqk is
equally hard as in E(Fq)
3) `k` is relatively small enough so that the arithmetic (pairing) in Fqk is easily computable.
